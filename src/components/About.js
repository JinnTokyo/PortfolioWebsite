        <p className="AboutMe">A few projects and a lot of front-end coding later, I stumbled 
          onto a business idea in the most unexpected 
          place—while chatting with <span className="highlight">ChatGPT</span>. 
          That’s how my <span className="highlight">AI Testimonial</span> website was born! Before that, 
          I had mostly been crafting the front-end for various projects, but this venture allowed me 
          to step into the entrepreneurial ring.</p>

        <p className="AboutMe2">Now, I’m bringing user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing interfaces
          to life while letting AI do some of the talking (literally).
          When I’m not coding, <span className="highlight">brainstorming</span> business ideas, or tinkering with designs, 
          you’ll probably find me planning my next <span className="highlight">front-end </span>
          experiment—or just hanging out, thinking about what project to dive into next!</p>

        <p className="AboutMe3">When I'm not working, I love to stay active 
          by <span className="highlight">jogging</span> and playing <span className="highlight"> tennis </span>  
          or <span className="highlight"> golf</span>. 
          I enjoy socializing and take pride in 
          dressing well. I'm also a big fan of collecting <span className="highlight"><b> perfumes </b></span>— there's 
          nothing like smelling good! On special occasions, I like to kick back with a 
          <span className="highlight"><b> glass of fine whiskey</b></span>, enjoying the moment with friends or family.</p>
